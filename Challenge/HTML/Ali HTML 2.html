      >The San Siro Stadium was built between 1 August 1925 and 15 September
      1926. In just over a year a structure capable of containing 35,000
      spectators was erected. It cost about 5 million Italia Lira to build and
      the construction was financed by then AC Milan president Piero Pirelli.</b
